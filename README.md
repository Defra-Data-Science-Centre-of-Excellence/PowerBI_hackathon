# 1. Introruction

Thank you for signing up to our PowerBI Hackathon! Here is some important information for the day:

- We assume that you are already onboarded to the platform. If true, you should be able to access our [Playbook](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/#content).
- The point of this hackathon is to help you create a finished product on the DASH platfrom. We have prepared this tutorial/walkthtough using sample datasets but you are very welcome to use other datasets of the DASH platfrom or your own data to create your product.
- If you chose to replicate the reports we have prepared for today, you will find within this repository their PDFs.

## 2.1 Accessing PowerBI & DASH data

- To open PowerBI, you will neeed to sign to the [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://client.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html). Please read through the [relevant chapter in our Playbook](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/avd.html) for more information on logging on and using the AVD.
- [Chapter 8.3](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/avd.html#avdpowerbi) provides a detail walkthrough on accessing data from PowerBI. We have used exactly the same dataset displayed in this chapter (the penguins!).
