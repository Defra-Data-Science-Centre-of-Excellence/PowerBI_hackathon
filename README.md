# 1. Introruction

Thank you for signing up to our PowerBI Hackathon! Here is some important information for the day:

- We assume that you are already onboarded to the platform. If true, you should be able to access our [Playbook](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/#content).
- The point of this hackathon is to help you create a finished product on the DASH platfrom. We have prepared this tutorial/walkthtough using sample datasets but you are very welcome to use other datasets of the DASH platfrom or your own data to create your product.
- If you chose to replicate the reports we have prepared for today, you will find within this repository their PDFs. .pbix are also available, but we'd advise you to not use these from the beginning.

# 2. Setting the scene

## 2.1 PowerBI workflows

{speak with Fluke I liked the idea of the flowchart that he mentioned} Yes!

## 2.2 Accessing PowerBI & DASH data

- To open PowerBI, you will neeed to sign to the [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://client.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html). Please read through the [relevant chapter in our Playbook](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/avd.html) for more information on logging on and using the AVD.
- [Chapter 8.3](https://dap-prd2-connect.azure.defra.cloud/DASH-Playbook/avd.html#avdpowerbi) provides a detail walkthrough on accessing data from PowerBI. We have used exactly the same dataset displayed in this chapter (the penguins!). 


## 2.3 Resources and Training

If you are not already a PowerBI evangelist, fear not. PowerBI is an extremely versatile and user friednly tool. We have provided below a list of resources to help you get started. Remember, it's always a good idea to google or we can try to answer any questions you might have. 

- Microsoft Learn
- Data Camp

# 3. Developing a product

## 3.1 Penguins

Here is the PDF copy of the PowerBI report that uses the penguin dataset. This report will be more suitable to people with limited or no previous experience on PowerBI. It focuses mainly on showcasing the 'power' and versatility of PowerBI, without focussing too much on the most complex parts of working with PowerBI, such as DAX and PowerQuery.

## 3.2 Leeds service request

Here is the PDF copy of the PowerBI report that uses the Leeds service request data. This report will be more suitable for you if you already feel somewhat confortable with PowerBI. It brings together all the features of PowerBI, including extrensive data cleaning in Power Query and creating measures using DAX.

## 3.3 Using your own data

- Here you can find information on how to upload your own data on the DASH platform.
- It might be a good idea to wireframe your end product / think of your user needs before creating visuals.

# 4. Your report

# 4.1. Saving

Thoough the AVD you should have access to your documents in OneDrive. Please save as soon as possible your report to a folder of your chosing and ensure you remember to hit the 'save' button at regular intervals.

# 4.2 Sharing

There are quite few options for sharing your dashboard. The one you chose will depend on your audience, functionality, and format you need.

- PDF: You can extract your report as a PDF file, which you can then share as widely as you want. However, there is limited interactivity preserved on PDFs.
- .pbix: You can share your shave .pbix file with colleagues who also have PowerBI desktop to open and view your file. This option is not recommended as it runs the risk of creating a seperate version of your file. This means that edits will live locally on each developer's laptop and will not update for the users.
- PowerBI service: You can publish your report to the PowerBI Service. This is the cloud version of PowerBI desktop, which allows you to host, update and share your PowerBI reports with your users. For today's session, we recommend that you chose 'My workspace'. For your future PowerBI projects, you might need to create or request access to your team's or project's PowerBI workspace.

# 4.3 Advertising

We hope you enjoyed spending the day on the DASH platform and we hope to see you again soon. We would be very keen to invite you to one of our Data Science Sessions or User Forums to share your experience and work wih more colleagues. This is part of our efforts to encourage users to familiarize and use DASH, as we move to our live phase of the DASH program.
